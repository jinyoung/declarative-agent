      "taskTitle": "Set up project structure and dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project structure setup task into specific subtasks covering directory creation, dependency management, Docker configuration, and environment setup. Include specific commands or code snippets for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup activities with a clear structure. It requires creating directories, setting up requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and environment variables. While straightforward for experienced developers, it involves multiple distinct steps that should be organized systematically."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agent Definition JSON Schema",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Agent Definition JSON Schema into subtasks covering Pydantic model creation, validation function implementation, testing with sample data, and documentation of the schema.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a structured Pydantic model with nested components and validation logic. The schema itself is already well-defined in the task description, but proper implementation requires attention to detail for the various nested models and validation functions."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement AgentManager for JSON loading",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AgentManager implementation into subtasks covering the core loading functionality, caching mechanism, error handling, and additional utility methods for agent management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a class that handles file I/O operations, JSON parsing, validation against a schema, and caching. It requires error handling for various scenarios and implementing additional methods for cache management and agent listing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement ToolFactory for creating LangChain tools",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ToolFactory implementation into subtasks covering the factory class structure, built-in tool implementations (calculator, search), MCP tool integration, error handling, and testing with different tool configurations.",
      "reasoning": "This task is more complex as it requires implementing a factory pattern that creates different types of LangChain tools based on configuration. Each tool type needs specific implementation logic, and the factory needs to handle various error cases. The integration with MCP tools adds another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement KnowledgeBaseLoader for vector and graph databases",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the KnowledgeBaseLoader implementation into subtasks covering the base class structure, vector database integration (FAISS), graph database integration (Neo4j), query template handling, error handling, and testing with different knowledge base configurations.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the integration with different database types (vector and graph) and the need to create appropriate LangChain tools for each. The Neo4j integration is particularly complex and requires specific knowledge of graph databases. Error handling across different database types adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Runtime Engine for LangChain AgentExecutor",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Runtime Engine implementation into subtasks covering agent creation, LLM initialization for different providers, tool assembly, persona/system prompt integration, and execution with proper error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating the core runtime that assembles and executes LangChain agents. It requires handling different LLM providers, integrating tools and knowledge bases, and ensuring proper persona injection. The asynchronous execution and error handling add complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement FastAPI endpoints for agent queries",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the FastAPI implementation into subtasks covering the basic application setup, query endpoint implementation, agent caching mechanism, additional management endpoints, and error handling with proper HTTP status codes.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a FastAPI application with endpoints for querying agents. It involves integrating with the AgentManager and RuntimeEngine components, implementing a caching mechanism for active agents, and proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create sample agent definitions",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of sample agent definitions into subtasks covering different agent types: a simple tool-based agent, a knowledge base agent, a multi-tool agent, and a complex agent combining multiple capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves creating JSON files based on the defined schema. The sample definitions are already provided in the task description, though creating additional examples and ensuring they work with the implemented system requires some attention to detail."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Docker containerization",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker containerization task into subtasks covering Dockerfile creation, docker-compose configuration, environment variable setup, and testing the containerized application.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard Docker configuration with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding of Docker concepts and ensuring the application runs correctly in a containerized environment with proper volume mounting and environment variable configuration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Create comprehensive documentation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation task into subtasks covering different documentation components: project overview, installation guide, agent definition format, API reference, usage examples, development guide, and troubleshooting section.",
      "reasoning": "Creating comprehensive documentation is moderately complex as it requires a deep understanding of all system components and the ability to explain them clearly. The task involves creating multiple documentation files with different focuses, including detailed API documentation, development guides, and usage examples."
